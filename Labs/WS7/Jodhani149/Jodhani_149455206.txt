By completing this workshop 7, I learned about the map concept using hashmap and did much practice with exceptional handling, arrays, methods and inheritance.

In task 2, we have entered data and matched it with the hashmap, so when a user enters data about the country name then it will find the capital of that country by matching entered country name.



Steps to run program:
Step 1: For Task 1, Go to Task 1 package, Click on Sorting.java and run.
Step 2: Enter file name to get output.
Step 3: For Task 2, Go to Task 2 package, Click on Capital.java and run.
Step 4: Enter country name to get capital of that country.
